## Assignment 4B Reflection

Were your predictions right?
Yes, my predictions were right based on the output from my functions.

What surprised you?
Nothing really surprised me because the data was pretty consistent and I already had a pretty good idea of my habits.

What was tricky or rewarding?
The tricky part was creating the four functions and making sure they actually worked with the data. It was rewarding to see the output make sense and match my predictions.

How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data made the project feel more real and it was easier for me to understand, because I knew what the numbers meant and could guess what the results should look like.
